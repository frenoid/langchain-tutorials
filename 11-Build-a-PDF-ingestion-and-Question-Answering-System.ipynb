    "PDF files often hold crucial unstructured data unavailable from other sources. They can be quite lengthy, and unlike plain text files, cannot generally be fed directly into the prompt of a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll create a system that can answer questions about PDF files. More specifically, you'll use a [Document Loader](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#document-loaders) to load text in a format usable by an LLM, then build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to answer questions, including citations from the source material.\n",

We'll use a document from [Nike's annual public SEC report](https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/2023/414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf).

    "Once you've chosen your PDF, the next step is to load it into a format that an LLM can more easily handle, since LLMs generally require text inputs. LangChain has a few different [built-in document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/) for this purpose which you can experiment with.
